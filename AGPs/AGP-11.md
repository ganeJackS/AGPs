# AGP-11: Aragon Association 2019 Budget


## Summary

The Aragon Association is the newly-created legal entity that oversees the Aragon Project's development during the decentralization process.

The Association's role is to manage the treasury, oversee the AGPprocess, and fund new teams working on Aragon.

In order to fulfill the above, the Association needs to hire a team and sustain different miscellaneous costs.

Therefore, it requests authorization to use the following funds from the Aragon treasury:


*   CHF820,000 in DAI-equivalent or Euro for 2019, for operational costs.
*   300,000 ANT vested over the next 3 years, for the long-term incentivization of the current team and future employees.


## Scope


### Legal

*   Drive the decentralization process of the Aragon Association into the Aragon Network.
*   Provide legal support to Aragon teams.
*   Ensure full compliance and minimize legal risks for the continued development of the project.


### Treasury management

*   Ensure the project has the resources it needs to continue and finish development of the network.
*   Diversify the capital base according to the project's needs.
*   Initiate and track payments to various teams, DAOs, and grant programs.


### Events

*   Organize AraCon
*   Oversee organization of other decentralized events and meetups


### Nest and Flock

*   Actively look for new teams that want to work on Aragon's products and infrastructure
*   Actively look for and encourage teams to build Aragon specific applications
*   Analyze team's applications
*   Manage the grant process and help teams navigate it
*   Monitor and track milestones and teams contributions
*   Evaluate contributions and act as a point-of-contact and liaison with other Aragon Flock teams to coordinate technical evaluations of commitments
*   Oversee the decentralization of the various grants programs
*   Clearly communicate with the Community all relevant updates regarding the grants programs by maintaining an open transparency portal


### Aragon Communications

*   Lead in spreading awareness of Aragon and decentralized organizations
*   Manage communications and content contractors
*   Manage aragon.org and blog.aragon.org


## Grant size

### Estimated operating costs for 2019 

The association would like to request CHF820,000 to cover the operating costs of 2019.

The estimated operating cost for 2019 is

*   Payroll: CHF450k
*   External services (including legal costs, HR, communications, accounting, banking, auditing, security, and more): CHF 350k
*   Travel expenses: CHF 25k
*   Business expenses: CHF 15k
*   Buffer (~5%): CHF 45k

We request the ability to both spend such funds from the Association's current treasury or transfer them to an Association specific DAO (whose members would include the Association's ED and the Board Members) or 


### ANT package

We would like to request 300,000 ANT, with 1-year cliff and 3-year vesting.

This ANT package will be primarily used to incentivize employees, by giving them ANT packages as well.

Most team members will vest during 4-years, but a 3 year total vesting is needed for the package of one employee.

The Association might request more ANT in coming years should it expand its team, which is unlikely at the moment.

## Team

### Current team

The current full-time team is comprised of 1 person, being the Executive Director, Stefano Bernardi.

The Association expects to hire in earnest two other people, with the potential addition of a third person during the year.

We plan to hire for the following positions:

*   Program Manager for Flock and Nest
*   Operations Manager

Later:
*   Events manager


## Requirements

*   Access to Aragon servers and cloud infrastructure
*   Admin/moderator access on aragon.chat, forum.aragon.org, and /r/AragonProject
*   Discretionary power over the Aragon treasury in case of emergency


## Organization structure

Aragon Association (Verein), an Association incorporated in Zug, Switzerland.
