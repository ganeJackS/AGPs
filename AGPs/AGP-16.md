## Motivation for making this change

Several community members expressed interest in extending the voting duration to make it less likely that a community member who wants to participate would not be able to due to scheduling.

Moving from 2 Days to 7 days ensures that if there is a specific period of a week which is preferable to a user to place their vote they are able to, while not extending the process too significantly.
