# AGP-19: Flock Funding for Autark

## Purpose of the transfer

Autark is a new organization that wants to be considered for Flock funding. Autark sees the adoption of Aragon as a way of expediting the future of work and society; one tailored around worker-autonomy, solidarity, reclaiming freedom, reclaiming land, and ultimately the stewardship for Planet Earth and all of its citizens.

To cover our operation costs, Autark requests:
* $390,000 paid in DAI to cover 26 weeks of operating costs for 6 full-time employees and contractors (February 3rd to August 3rd 2019)
* 350,000 ANT as an incentivization package for the 6 full-time employees. This ANT will have a 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting.
