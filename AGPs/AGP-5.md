# AGP-5: Aragon Flock proposal for Aragon One

## Address of the transfer recipient
We request funds to be sent to the multisig `0xa41a8ce739a0ac33db3d60917b8c327bac506349`. This multisig will be used for the cold storage of received funds.

Funding needed for operations will be then sent and managed by the Aragon One DAO ([`a1.aragonid.eth`](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/a1.aragonid.eth/)) on the Ethereum Mainnet.

## Amount of the transfer
- $4m in DAI (or other stable assets, such as fiat)
- 1,675,000 ANT

## Number and frequency of transfers
- The $4m payment is one-off
- The 1,675,000 ANT will vest over the next 4 years
  - Due to existing ANT commitments with employees, we request the cliff to happen in ~9 months instead of 12 months. This would be on October 1st, 2019
  - For the remaining 3 years of vesting, the remaining 75% of the tokens will be freed at 25% per year
  - 100% of the tokens would be freed on October 1st, 2022

## Purpose of the transfer
Aragon Flock proposal, as [stated in the Flock repo](https://github.com/aragon/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md). The proposal was [pre-approved and merged](https://github.com/aragon/flock/pull/1#pullrequestreview-186455646) into the Flock repo on Dec 19th, 2018.
