# AGP-66: Panvala Launch Partnership

## Address of the transfer recipient
The address of Panvala's token capacitor smart contract will be determined when
it is deployed on mainnet. Instead of a direct transfer, this proposal gives
the Aragon Association the authority to make transfers over time.

## Amount of the transfer
Up to $2,000,000.

## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)
Up to 24 monthly transfers of $83,333.33 each. Contributions can be made for up to three months
at a time, but without allowing a month to pass after any of the individual
scheduled contributions. These recurring transfers can be stopped at the
discretion of either the Aragon Association or Aragon Network Token holders.

## Purpose of the transfer

Panvala is a donor-driven platform that helps fund the work that the whole Ethereum community depends on. You can think of it as a decentralized version of the Ethereum Foundation that runs on its own token. Details of Panvala’s goals and design are available in the [Panvala Whitepaper](https://v.fastcdn.co/u/b75396d2/44139515-0-Panvala-Whitepaper-J.pdf).

In Panvala’s [first batch of grants](https://medium.com/@Panvala/twelve-grants-awarded-in-batch-one-of-panvala-token-grants-59b8df7422fe) released on February 1, Aragon One earned 300,000 PAN for their work on the [Voting Relay Protocol](https://forum.aragon.org/t/simple-voting-relay-protocol-optimistic-vote-tallying/473), a layer 2 protocol to scale token voting on Ethereum. Those tokens will be included in the initial token distribution when Panvala launches on the mainnet in August.

10,000,000 PAN have been set aside to divide between Panvala Launch Partners, selected grant recipients who have committed to donate pan they earn or purchase from other grantees over the first two years of Panvala. Launch Partners receive voting power for fulfilling their pledge. This AGP proposes giving the Aragon Association permission to donate up to 2 million USD over two years to Panvala on behalf of Aragon One. The final amount will be chosen by the Aragon Association as they see fit.

The proposal is not aimed at redirecting funds from the Aragon treasury. The primary method of fulfilling this pledge should be by Aragon continuing to independently fund common Ethereum infrastructure through Flock and Nest grants. Those grantees should apply for Panvala token grants for any portion of their work that benefits the whole Ethereum ecosystem. Some or all of the Panvala tokens earned by these teams should be sent to the Aragon Association, which will donate those tokens to fulfill their pledge. It is possible to fulfill Aragon’s Launch Partner pledge without spending any money from the Aragon Association’s treasury. Authority to spend from the treasury is being granted to account for any mismatch between scheduled contributions and the actual flow of tokens earned by Aragon teams.

Voting tokens are released as the pledge is fulfilled. Either Aragon or the Aragon Association can decide to stop fulfilling the pledge at any point. The remaining token allocation will be forfeited at that point, but all tokens earned thus far will be retained.

In Panvala, token holders decide which grants are issued. It’s important for Aragon to be able to influence these decisions to ensure that the scaling and security work the Aragon Network depends on for its success can be prioritized. Putting these decisions as close to the teams building on Ethereum is what will set us on a path towards establishing Ethereum as the settlement layer for the world’s open financial system, with Aragon as one of its premier applications.

We look forward to continued cooperation between the Aragon and Panvala communities.
