# AGP-7: Flock Funding for Aragon DAC

## Address of the transfer recipient

0x2b44a157d69cad4842f022bd09d099936e8a12b7 

## Amount of the transfer

333,000 DAI

## Number and frequency of transfers if recurring (enter “1” if only one payment will be made)

## Purpose of the transfer

The Aragon DAC wants to be considered for Flock funding. 

To cover our operation costs, the AragonDAC requests:
* 333,000 DAI to cover 6 months of opperational costs (until July 31st)
* 80,000 ANT as an incentivization package with a 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting

With these funds, we beleive we can dramatically impact the developer experience, make significant progress on enabling Dapp-DAO interactions, document valuable use cases
and help to onboard and educate the Ethereum community (with a special focus on developers) to the Aragon Platform.
