Due to potential network instability [around the time](https://twitter.com/5chdn/status/1079095325325955073) of Ethereumâ€™s [Constantinople hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1013), the Aragon Association Board of Directors has voted to approve an emergency one-week delay of the upcoming AGP vote and review period.

Please help spread the word to any ANT holders that you know!

The new scheduled start dates are:
AA Review: Thursday, January 10th
Community final review: Thursday, January 17th
AGP Vote: Thursday, January 24th

Start times are still 00:00 UTC, and the AGP vote will still last for 48 hours.

We will continue to monitor Ethereum network conditions and may announce further emergency delays if necessary to preserve the integrity of the vote.

The upside of this delay is that there is now more time to [submit and review proposals](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pulls).

Thank you for understanding and participating in Aragon governance!

Luis and Jorge
